# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
 * Not very confident on this one. I need more work but it's late and I'll come back to it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
 * I went with the easier challenge for now because this late it is an unproductive struggle to find code to only print words 3 letter in length. It's too late to expect any response.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
 * All of it!! It's getting to a point where I'm wondering what I just did an hour ago.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 * Watching what others come up with. Ask in Slack. Ask in StackExchange even.
